              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                This project explores the relationship between economic output
                and human development using country-level data on GDP per capita
                and the Human Development Index (HDI). The core question is
                simple but important:
                <em
                  >Do higher-income countries always deliver better human
                  outcomes?</em
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Using Python, I carried out an exploratory analysis to
                understand global patterns, regional clusters, and exceptions to
                the rule — countries that achieve relatively high human
                development despite modest income levels.

              <h2>Analytical Approach</h2>
              <p>
                The analysis is structured as a clear, reproducible workflow
                inside a Jupyter Notebook:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Loading and cleaning HDI and GDP per capita data for multiple
                  countries and regions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Creating scatterplots to visualise the relationship between
                  GDP and HDI, including log-scaling GDP for readability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Highlighting regional groupings (such as Sub-Saharan Africa,
                  Europe & Central Asia, East Asia & Pacific) to compare
                  trajectories.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Identifying countries that “punch above their weight” on HDI
                  relative to income.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The focus is not only on correlation, but on the distribution
                and shape of the relationship: where it holds, where it bends,
                and where it breaks.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Key Insights</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There is a clear positive relationship between GDP per capita
                  and HDI, but it is not linear and not mechanical. Income
                  creates possibilities — it does not guarantee outcomes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sub-Saharan Africa shows a visible cluster of countries with
                  both low GDP and low HDI, but also a few emerging movers that
                  are improving on one or both dimensions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Some countries, such as Cabo Verde or Bhutan–type profiles,
                  achieve relatively strong HDI scores despite modest income
                  levels. This suggests effective investment in health,
                  education, and social infrastructure.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                These patterns matter because they move the conversation beyond
                “rich vs poor” and towards how well countries convert economic
                resources into human wellbeing.
              </p>
            </section>

            <section>
              <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
              <p>
                For policymakers, donors, and analysts, this kind of work
                supports more nuanced benchmarking: not just “who is rich?” but
                “who is doing the most with what they have?”.
              </p>
              <p>
                From a technical point of view, the project demonstrates how
                Python can be used to: structure messy development data, create
                interpretable visuals, and guide deeper questions rather than
                just produce a single summary statistic.
              </p>
