        <h1>Power BI Case Study: Retail Performance & Customer Insight</h1>
    
        <section>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
        This project simulates a real engagement with a mid-sized retail group operating across multiple city branches. 
        The company was experiencing uneven store performance, declining customer satisfaction in key locations, 
        and limited visibility into patterns that could guide better operational decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Understanding the Business Context</h2>
    <p>
        Retail environments generate large volumes of granular data — sales, inventory movements, customer behaviour, 
        seasonal shifts, and promotion responses. But without structure, this data becomes noise. 
        The leadership team needed a way to see what was actually happening: 
        which branches were thriving, which were lagging, and why.
    </p>

    <p>
        My role in this simulated engagement was to take a raw dataset and build a dashboard that could surface 
        meaningful patterns: revenue variation, product category performance, profitability pressures, 
        and customer experience signals. 
        The goal was not only to visualise the numbers, but to reveal the story behind them.
    </p>

    <h2>Analytical Approach</h2>
    <p>
        I began by examining sales performance across stores, drilling into monthly trends, 
        peak periods, and fluctuations that suggested operational challenges. 
        Category-level analysis highlighted which products were driving revenue vs. which ones created bottlenecks. 
    </p>

    <p>
        One particularly important layer was customer feedback data. When mapped against revenue and footfall, 
        it revealed patterns that were easy to miss at the surface — several branches with high foot traffic were 
        underperforming due to consistent dissatisfaction with service and stock availability. 
        These relationships became clear only once the data was unified into a single analytical view.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Dashboard Shows</h2>
    <p>
        The Power BI dashboard provides:
        <ul>
            <li>Branch-level performance with interactive comparisons</li>
            <li>Category and product trends across time</li>
            <li>Customer satisfaction patterns mapped to revenue</li>
            <li>Operational red flags such as stockouts, low-margin items, and declining branches</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Together, these views help decision-makers see not just <em>what</em> is happening, 
        but <em>why</em>. Patterns that were previously hidden — especially the link between 
        customer experience and revenue dips — become part of the strategic conversation.
    </p>

    <h2>Strategic Narrative</h2>
    <p>
        When synthesised, the data tells a simple but powerful story: performance is not evenly distributed, 
        and customer experience is the strongest predictor of sustained revenue. 
        Branches that maintained strong service scores consistently outperformed those with recurring complaints, 
        even when foot traffic levels were similar.
    </p>

    <p>
        This insight shifts the business question from “Which branches are underperforming?” 
        to “What is happening inside each branch’s customer journey that drives or undermines revenue?” 
        That is the level of clarity a dashboard like this enables — a shift from observation to understanding.
    </p>

      <!-- SECOND DASHBOARD -->
      <p>
        This dashboard reflects the broader philosophy that guides my work: data is most valuable 
        when it reveals the relationships that shape real-world outcomes. 
        By bringing sales, customer feedback, and product performance into one view, 
        the organisation gains a clearer picture of where to intervene, where to invest, 
        and how to improve the overall customer experience.
