          <p>
            This project is designed as an
            <strong>executive-level “pulse” dashboard</strong> that gives
            leadership a clear, integrated view of organisational health. The
            focus is not on one tool or one dataset, but on how people,
            customers, operations, and finances fit together as a single system.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dashboard concept is tool-agnostic: it can be built in Looker
            Studio, Power BI, Tableau, or any modern BI platform. What matters
            is the thinking behind it — the way information is structured so
            that senior decision-makers can see what is working, what is
            fragile, and where to act.
          </p>

          <h2>The Four Pillars of Organisational Health</h2>
          <p>
            The Performance Pulse is organised around four core dimensions that
            cut across almost any organisation:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>People &amp; Culture:</strong> engagement levels,
              turnover, sick leave, onboarding throughput, internal survey
              signals, and basic capacity indicators.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Customers &amp; Market:</strong> new vs returning
              customers, churn, satisfaction scores, complaints, NPS-style
              feedback, and simple funnel conversion metrics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Operations &amp; Reliability:</strong> delivery times,
              error rates, backlog, rework, service uptime, and quality issues
              that directly affect trust.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Financial Pulse:</strong> revenue trends, margin, cost
              pressures, cash position, and short, readable indicators of
              financial resilience.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each pillar answers a basic question:
            <em>Are we healthy here, are we drifting, or are we in trouble?</em>
            The dashboard brings these answers into a single frame so that
            leadership can see patterns across the system, not just isolated
            metrics.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Analytical Logic Behind the Dashboard</h2>
          <p>
            The design starts with the decisions executives actually need to
            make. From there, I work backwards: which signals matter most, what
            time horizon they need to be seen over, and how much detail is
            useful before the view becomes noise.
          </p>
          <p>In practice, that means:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Selecting a small, disciplined set of KPIs for each pillar rather
              than tracking everything that moves.
            </li>
            <li>
              Using trends and simple comparisons (month-on-month, year-on-year,
              target vs actual) instead of dense tables that leaders do not have
              time to interpret.
            </li>
            <li>
              Linking metrics across pillars — for example, changes in staff
              turnover showing up later in customer complaints or delivery
              delays.
            </li>
            <li>
              Flagging thresholds and inflection points so that attention is
              drawn where it is needed most.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The result is a dashboard that behaves less like a static report and
            more like a living instrument panel for the organisation.
          </p>

          <h2>How This Helps Leadership Teams</h2>
          <p>
            For a CEO, COO, or Head of Strategy, the Performance Pulse dashboard
            offers three main kinds of value:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Clarity:</strong> a single place to see how people,
              customers, operations, and finance are moving together, rather
              than jumping between disconnected reports.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Early Warning:</strong> the ability to spot drift early —
              for example, a slow rise in errors or a gentle decline in repeat
              customers before it turns into a crisis.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Storytelling:</strong> a shared, visual narrative that
              makes it easier to align teams around what is really happening,
              instead of debating whose spreadsheet is correct.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My role in a project like this is to translate scattered data
            sources into a coherent, senior-ready view: defining the right
            metrics, shaping the structure, and ensuring that the dashboard is
            honest, interpretable, and useful in real conversations.
          </p>

          <h2>Interactive Pulse Dashboard</h2>
          <p>
            An interactive version of this dashboard will appear here soon. It
            will showcase the full Executive Pulse model using a BI tool such as
            Looker Studio or Power BI.
