          The Uncomfortable Truth About Data-Driven Decision Making
        </h1>
        <p class="blog-date">Published on February 15, 2025</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          “Data-driven decision making” has become a kind of magic phrase in
          organisations. If a report has charts, if a slide has numbers, if a
          dashboard has filters and glowing KPIs, it feels responsible and
          modern to say: “We made this decision based on the data.” But that
          sentence often hides more than it reveals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In practice, data can create a powerful illusion of certainty.
          Dashboards can make shaky assumptions look solid. Statistical noise
          can be mistaken for a trend. And complex human realities can be
          squeezed into a few neat indicators that feel objective, even when
          they are incomplete or biased. This post sits with that tension.
        </p>

        <hr />

        <h2>The Promise of Data-Driven Decisions</h2>
        <p>
          The promise is appealing: collect good data, analyse it carefully, and
          you will avoid gut feel, politics, and guesswork. You will catch
          problems earlier, target resources more efficiently, and justify
          decisions with something more solid than opinion. At its best, data
          really can do this. It can reveal patterns no one saw, challenge
          assumptions, and discipline our thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the promise quietly assumes that the data is complete, the model
          is appropriate, the visualisation is honest, and the people reading it
          understand what they are looking at. Those conditions are rare.
        </p>

        <h2>Where Data Misleads</h2>
        <p>Data misleads us in subtle ways:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We mistake <strong>correlation for causation</strong> and build
            stories that the evidence cannot support.
          </li>
          <li>
            We focus on what is easy to measure and ignore what is important but
            messy or qualitative.
          </li>
          <li>
            We treat projections and models as if they were forecasts of the
            future rather than disciplined guesses.
          </li>
          <li>
            We forget the people and processes behind the data – how it was
            collected, cleaned, and framed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Visualisations can make this worse. A confident line chart or bold KPI
          hides uncertainty. Confidence intervals, caveats, and assumptions are
          often stripped away for the sake of simplicity. The result is a clean
          picture that feels more true than it actually is.
        </p>

        <h2>Critical Data Thinking</h2>
        <p>
          The alternative is not to reject data, but to adopt a posture of
          <em>critical data thinking</em>. That means asking simple but
          demanding questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            What is this number actually measuring – and what is it leaving out?
          </li>
          <li>How was this data produced, and by whom?</li>
          <li>What assumptions are built into this model or dashboard?</li>
          <li>Where is the uncertainty, and how big might it be?</li>
          <li>
            Who benefits if we read the data in one way rather than another?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          It also means holding space for other ways of knowing: qualitative
          accounts, frontline experience, and lived realities that do not fit
          neatly into a spreadsheet. Data should inform judgment, not replace
          it.
        </p>

        <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
        <p>
          The uncomfortable truth is that “data-driven” can be just as
          ideological as any other decision-making style if we treat the outputs
          as unquestionable. The more honest aspiration is to be
          <strong>data-informed and critically aware</strong>: using data to
          sharpen our thinking while staying alert to its limits.
        </p>
        <p>
          That requires humility, curiosity, and a willingness to say “we don’t
          know enough yet” even when a dashboard looks beautifully complete. It
          is slower in the short term, but far wiser in the long run.
