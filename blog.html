          Thinking in Data, Systems, and Behaviour
        </h1>
        <p class="blog-description">
          This blog is where I think aloud about data, decisions, and the
          systems that sit beneath everyday numbers. Some posts are about
          dashboards and tools, but the real focus is on how organisations make
          sense of the world: what they see, what they miss, and how that shapes
          the choices they make.
        </p>

        <p>
          I write as a practitioner who moves between analytics, research, and
          strategy. That means paying attention not just to visualisations and
          KPIs, but also to uncertainty, bias, behaviour, and context. The aim
          is always the same: to move from noise to clarity, and from clarity to
          better decisions.

        <h2>What I Write About</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Data & decision-making</strong> – when data helps, when it
            misleads, and how to stay critical.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Visualisation & dashboards</strong> – beyond pretty charts
            to actually useful tools.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Behaviour & systems</strong> – why people do what they do
            inside complex organisations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Development & cities</strong> – how data shapes the way we
            think about African cities and futures.
          </li>
        </ul>

              We like to believe that more data automatically means better
              decisions. This post explores how dashboards and analytics can
              create false certainty, hide uncertainty, and quietly reinforce
              bias if we don’t stay critical.

            <p>
              From AI-generated visuals to animated dashboards, data has never
              looked better. But does this actually help people think more
              clearly, or are we drifting into aesthetic-driven storytelling
              that looks smart while saying very little?
